# Matrimonial-App
Matrimonial App is a modern matrimonial Android application designed to provide users with potential match profiles in a swipeable, card-style format inspired by platforms like Shaadi.com. It utilizes real-time data fetched from RandomUser.me API and combines modern Android development principles to ensure smooth, offline-first interaction.  
The app presents each profile with essential details (photo, name, age, location, etc.), and users can either Accept or Decline matches. These decisions are stored locally using Room database, allowing the app to function seamlessly even without an internet connection.
